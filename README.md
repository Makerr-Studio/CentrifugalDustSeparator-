<h2>Changelog:</h2><br>
06-10-2024: Prusa printable Y-pieces added to folder <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="MK2/STEP/">MK2/STEP</a><br>
29-09-2024: Changed the README file to better explain the differend design folder.<br>
28-09-2024: I did find out that a normal nut won't lock the impeller assembly for the long run. PLA will shrink/compress over time, and loosens the nut. Use a spring washer & lock nut instead!<br>
14-09-2024: Added the REV2 files of the Y-pieces + brackeds. They need less material to print now by removing the needs for support. Thx @philreindl for the tip!<br>
11-09-2024: In the folder <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="MK2_EU/">MK2_EU</a> I added the Shaper files (.svg and also the .DXF's) and the Fusion archive files (.f3d) of the baseplate and cleat.<br>
08-09-2024: Parts for the French Cleats added. Fusion file is in the making. Type of compresion tape added.<br>
05-09-2024: Parts for the T-Loc added. Note: I did not print the latch and latch cover (these are just the 3D STEP files I used for the design, feel free to try to 3D print them)<br>
24-08-2024: MK2_EU Inlet and outlet parts adjusted for a better O-ring seal/fit for the 120x3mm O-rings.<br>
19-08-2024: Added 120x3mm O-rings i switced to while building the EU version. Still need to change the parts for a better fit. Will make testprints for this in the next weeks.<br>
